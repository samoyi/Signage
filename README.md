## TODO
* **TODO-1**: When routing from `App.vue`, different components need different
props, I have to put all props in the one `<router-view>`. There should be a
better way.
* **TODO-2**: In `App.vue`, the root instance have a property of `name`, which
is generated by `webpack-simple` automatically. What is it for?
* 新添加的水牌不能删除和修改，因为删除和修改需要提交table_id。应该改为提交key
